## Introduction

This is the front end of our Makers Academy Final Project, Attendr. Attendr is an events driven dating platform which matches people based on events they are both interested in.

This part of the application is reliant on our cloud server, written in NodeJS. You can find the source code, and hosted example here:
Backend is hosted on Heroku - [Link](http://www.attendr-server.herokuapp.com)

## Other Information

Overall, the project was a really useful challenge to gauge how much we have learnt in the last twelve weeks. At the end of the day, I feel the quality of the work is pretty impressive given that we had two weeks to build the whole system in a environment and language we'd never used before. TDD in xCode remains a massive headache and it's something I'd want to face into head on the next time I take on a challenge like this. The quality of the code is also fairly low, and is in need of a good cleanup refactor, which is high on my list of things to do.
